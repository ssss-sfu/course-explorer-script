                        "courseDetails": "You will learn computer science concepts and solve real-world problems using the C++ programming language. Example programs we create will show how computer science can be used for good in areas such as social justice, environmental protection, and health care support world wide. Through this we'll look at the challenges some SFU CS student-lead projects aim to address in the world! <br /><br />This course will use a flipped classroom: each week programming techniques will be taught in a series of online videos. Lecture time will be interactive and focus on writing programs and modelling applied problem solving. Students are recommended to bring a laptop to lecture, if possible. Labs will help you apply the ideas you have learned with the support of TAs. Assignments will help further build your confidence with problem solving through programming. Some assignments will allow you to work with a partner (if you choose). Once you have successfully completed the course, you will have the necessary skills to program the computer to solve interesting problems. Plus, you will appreciate and write quality code for good causes. <br /><br />New AI tools (like ChatGPC and Co-pilot) can complement many of the skills taught in this class. However, students must learn to write the code themselves and not just rely on an AI. To ensure students are learning the material by completing assignments, there will be an in-class quiz announced for most assignments. A student's mark for each assignment will be calculated as: (their percentage on the assignment submission) * (their percentage on the assignment's quiz). For example, a student who earns 95% on their assignment submission, and 86% on the associated quiz will earn 81.7% for that assignment overall.<br />\r\n<h2 class=\"ParagraphTitle\">Topics</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Elementary programming: data types and basic input and output</li>\r\n<li>Functions: function libraries, passing parameters, returning values, the call stack</li>\r\n<li>Control structures: Boolean logic, if statements, loops</li>\r\n<li>Aggregate Data Types: arrays, strings, structures</li>\r\n<li>Dynamic memory: pointers and addresses, and allocation of dynamic memory</li>\r\n<li>File input and output</li>\r\n<li>Errors and debugging</li>\r\n</ul>",

The core around which the course is built is C, assembly, and low-level data representation, but this is connected to higher levels (roughly how basic other programming langauges could could be implemented), lower levels (the general structure of a processor), and the role of the processor and its how it is implemented. This course provides an introduction to computer organization, systems programming and the hardware/software interface. Topics include instruction sets, computer arithmetic, datapath design, data formats, addressing modes, memory hierarchies including caches and virtual memory, and multicore architectures. Students learn assembly language programming and design a pipelined RISC V processor. The course is open to any undergraduate who has mastered the 120s material.<br /><br /><strong>RISC V:&nbsp;</strong>This version of the course will study the core components in computer architecture through the lens of the RISC-V (V : Five) ISA. What is RISC V? It is a modern open source instruction set that enables students to learn both assembly-level programming and the digital design of a processor. **This course is a hands-on, programming-heavy course**. Expect to get down and get your hands dirty with C programming and hardware design. We will discuss the fundamental design and engineering trade-offs in computer architecture at every level.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Course Offer Plan:</strong> <br />- <strong>Lab:</strong> There will be dedicated lab days. (required lab). Attendance is required and counts towards your overall grade.zoom/in-person&nbsp; <br />- <strong>Biweekly quizzes</strong> - There will be quiz every week administer and graded online. These will be graded. **Instructor Hours (50 minute session) will be instructor hours. Synchronous 1-1 sessions that you can reserve (zoom). <br />- <strong>Lecture (1hr 50minute)</strong> will be in-person lecture day. I will be on presenting the major concepts fom the week's module. Further time will be spent on answering class-wide questions. <br />- <strong>Videos</strong>&nbsp;- All lecture content will be made available as videos atleast 1 week prior. The expectation is that these videos are watched prior to the class. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><strong>Text<strong> books<br /></strong><br /></strong></strong>&nbsp;Please try and obtain the eversions of these text books. Please continue to check our course outline for further information. Should this course be taught remotely due to pandemic, students must have access to a computer with internet access, allowing the use of a conferencing system such as Zoom or BB Collaborate Ultra. Some components of the course will require synchronous (real-time) participation during the scheduled lecture and/or exam times. Visual proctoring will most likely be required for midterms and exams. Midterms and Exams will be held in person.<br /><strong><strong><br /><strong>Workload comments<br /><br /></strong></strong></strong>&nbsp;The comments below are provided based on past student experience. It is to enable you to appropriately select the term in which you take 295. As the first introduction to systems, 295 is an intense course and requires 1) watching 3hrs of async. video /week 2) 1hr50m of in-class activity 3) 20m of quizes/week 4) 1 hr of labs/week 5) 5 hrs / week for take-home programming assignments (assumes familiarity with C/C++). Your learning outcomes in 295 are highly dependent on whether you are comfortable with the material, and C/C++ programming from 125 and 135. 295 is set up to make you a better programmer and this requires the student to invest the requisite time. As our grading distribution shows; all components are equally important. Hence, please take it in the term that you can dedicate the time.<br /><br /><strong>Prerequisite notes:</strong><br /><br />Programming skills (C++ or C).

You will have learned bare-metal development (no OS), Linux device driver creation, and be able to read basic hardware circuits. You will have demonstrated a mastery of embedded development on the course group project by implementing a stand-alone product or by interfacing with a larger system. The assignments and project require a significant amount of time to complete.

Some projects will require group communication and collaboration.<br />\r\n<h2 class=\"ParagraphTitle\">Topics</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Testing techniques</li>\r\n<li>Measuring how well software is tested</li>\r\n<li>Automated test generation</li>\r\n<li>Program analysis technologies and techniques</li>\r\n<li>Assessing program performance</li>\r\n<li>Understanding security concerns</li>\r\n<li>Empirical methods for reliability</li>\r\n</ul>",

In particular, given a specification of the software, formal verification aims to prove or disprove that the software indeed satisfies the specification. This course mainly introduces deductive verification, one of the most important and popular methods for formal verification, including its logic foundations, constraint solving techniques, and verification methodologies. It also helps students get hands-on experience with a modern constraint solver Z3 and a deductive verifier Dafny.<br /><br />\r\n<h2 class=\"ParagraphTitle\">Topics</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Propositional logic</li>\r\n<li>First-order logic</li>\r\n<li>First-order theories</li>\r\n<li>SAT/SMT solvers</li>\r\n<li>Hoare logic</li>\r\n<li>Deductive verification</li>\r\n</ul>",
